# cloudformation_templates

## Synopsis

A collection of CloudFormation templates I've crafted over time. 

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Just clone the repo down and you are good to go!


## Contributors

So far...just me @elnica6.
